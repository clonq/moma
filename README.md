Model mapper for node.js

Why
---
We need an easy way to map a set of fields from one model to another. It could be the data model we fetched from the database that we want exposed to the web layer in a limited fashion. Or it could be the form data submitted from a web page that we want to massage in a model suitable for the database. Or it can be any other model you can think of.
